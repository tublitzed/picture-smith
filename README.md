# picture-smith
A sample app to learn [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), and play around with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

The app will take a simple sentence and transform it into pictures using the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) API.

## Installation

- `npm install`
- You will need a [noun project account](https://thenounproject.com). Create one, and grab your API key and secret.
- `cp .env.example .env`
- Now, replace the default values in `.env` with your Noun Project key & secret.
- `npm start` to start the server.
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/`

For best results, try simple sentences, like "cats are cool", or "bacon is good".
